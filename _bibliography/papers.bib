  abstract = {This paper explores adversarial attacks on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based radio resource management in point-to-point (P2P) communications. The trained GNN model, which receives information from transceiver pairs, is targeted during the test phase. The paper introduces a novel adversarial attack that modifies the vertices of the GNN model, taking into account various constraints. The attack’s effectiveness is evaluated based on the number of users and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed attack formulates optimization problems aimed at minimizing system communication quality, incorporating specific constraints.},

  abstract = {This This paper proposes and analyses a set of novel and optimum multi-streaming techniques for mmWave multi-input multi-output systems. It formulates an optimization problem that enables exploiting available uncorrelated paths between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) to enhance the system throughput. In the proposed approach, antenna arrays at Tx/Rx are modeled as a Bipartite graph. Next, two bi-clustering algorithms are applied to the graph to simultaneously cluster antenna elements at Tx and Rx. In addition, the paper shows how the selection of subchannels and their corresponding subantenna arrays can be reduced to a variant of the graph coloring problem, based on which, two algorithms are proposed to find the optimum subchannels and subantenna arrays. Moreover, the paper defines two new beamforming methods and proves that those methods satisfy constant modulus and total power constraints. The first modified beamforming method uses singular vectors (SVs) of subchannels between Tx/Rx and incorporates the Power Iteration algorithm to decrease singular value decomposition complexity. The second newly proposed beamforming method finds precoders/combiners without using SVs which reduces the computational complexity. Performance evaluations in terms data streaming sum-rate demonstrate that the proposed technique increases the throughput using a low processing complexity.},

The knowledge of eigenvalue distribution of the imperfectly estimated CSI between transmitter (TX) and users’ antennas is key to techniques that suppress the impact of imperfect CSI on communication performance. This paper numerically depicts that this distribution follow a power-law distribution. In addition, this paper investigates the impact of channel estimation error, the number of antenna elements at TX and users, and the number of users on the eigen value distribution.},

  abstract={Prior to the 21st century, positioning technologies had limited applications including air traffic control, air and sea navigation, satellite communications and related military uses. Today, positioning technologies have deeply merged with daily life and enabled many novel sensors, systems and services. For example, navigation systems are the enablers of road traffic prediction, assisted and autonomous driving, and several aspects of healthcare. They have also facilitated worldwide services provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. In fact, in many aspects of modern life, localization systems are deemed essential to day-to-day living and are contributing to our general well-being, the economy, and security. Accordingly, position location technologies have become key components of many worldwide industries. These positioning technologies include the Global Positioning System (GPS), WiFi-based indoor localization, cell-phone based localization (including the fusion of GPS, cell-tower based localization and dead-reckoning), and inertial/dead-reckoning techniques. Tracking technologies are also considered key components for localization, as are the more recently integrated concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This paper provides a review of the history of localization, the main technological enablers of localization and assesses the future directions of localization methods.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
