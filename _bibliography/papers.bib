  abstract = {This paper explores adversarial attacks on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based radio resource management in point-to-point (P2P) communications. The trained GNN model, which receives information from transceiver pairs, is targeted during the test phase. The paper introduces a novel adversarial attack that modifies the vertices of the GNN model, taking into account various constraints. The attack’s effectiveness is evaluated based on the number of users and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed attack formulates optimization problems aimed at minimizing system communication quality, incorporating specific constraints.},

  abstract = {Imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) reduces communication performance of mmWave communication that uses massive antennas. The knowledge of eigenvalue distribution of the imperfectly estimated CSI between transmitter (TX) and users’ antennas is key to techniques that suppress the impact of imperfect CSI on communication performance. This paper numerically depicts that this distribution follow a power-law distribution. In addition, this paper investigates the impact of channel estimation error, the number of antenna elements at TX and users, and the number of users on the eigen value distribution.},

  abstract={This paper offers a new approach for antenna clustering and hybrid beamforming applicable to massive MIMO systems. Simultaneous clustering and hybrid beamforming across Tx and Rx antennas is an NP-hard problem. To address this issue, first, the paper proposes an antenna clustering that is applied to both Tx and Rx. In this regard, antenna arrays at Tx and Rx are modeled as a Bipartite graph and for the first time, one bi-clustering algorithm, Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm, is applied to achieve simultaneous clustering. Next, singular vectors of subchannels, which are the channels between subantenna arrays of Tx and Rx, are comprised to determine optimal precoders/combiners. Performance evaluations in terms of Tx-Rx data streaming sum-rate demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
