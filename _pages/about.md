I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst). My work focuses on developing efficient end-to-end Deep Learning and Tiny Machine Learning pipelines for drone applications and radio resource management. Additionally, as a Lecturer at UMass Amherst, I teach advanced graduate courses in signal processing, efficient machine learning, and image processing.



With extensive experience as a Research Scientist in Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning, my expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of ML/DL domains. I specialize in Graph Neural Networks, Tiny ML, and Signal Processing, consistently pushing the boundaries of these technologies.

I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, and signal processing. My current research focus is on **Efficient Deep Learning**, **On-device/Tiny ML**, and **Generative AI**. I am currently working on the following research themes, applied to radio resource management and drones:

- Efficient and Tiny Graph Neural Networks 
- Efficient Training and Fine-tuning of Large Models
- Efficient Generative Models

I previously received a Ph.D. in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in August 2023, and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University.
