I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), where I focus on developing real-time, efficient deep learning models for edge devices and physical systems. My work spans audio signal processing, machine learning, and TinyML, with a strong emphasis on creating low-latency, AI-powered solutions that operate on physical hardware. As a Lecturer at UMass Amherst, I also teach advanced graduate courses in digital signal processing, efficient machine learning, and applied deep learning techniques.

<! -- With extensive experience as a Research Scientist in machine learning and digital signal processing (DSP), my expertise covers source separation, speech enhancement, and microphone array signal processing. I specialize in applying machine learning to real-time systems, focusing on lightweight, low-latency models for resource-constrained devices—such as those required for AI-powered audio processing in real-time physical environments.

<! --I specialize in Signal Processing, Graph Neural Networks, and Tiny ML, consistently pushing the boundaries of these technologies.-->

I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, and signal processing. My current research is centered around **Efficient Deep Learning**, **On-device/Tiny ML**, and **Generative AI**. I am currently working on the following research themes, applied to Radio Resource Management and Drones:

- Model compression techniques, including quantization, pruning, neural architecture search, and low-rank approximation, to optimize performance for low-resource devices
- Efficient and Tiny Graph Neural Networks 
- Efficient Training and Fine-tuning of Large Models
- Efficient Generative Models

I hold a Ph.D. in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I developed scalable machine learning models for real-time applications, and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University. My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical applications, driving the future of AI-driven technologies.
