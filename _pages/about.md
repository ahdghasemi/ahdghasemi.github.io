I am a lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), where I teach advanced graduate-level courses in efficient machine learning, image processing, and signal processing. Concurrently, I serve as a Machine Learning consultant at SoliX (funded by the USDA), focusing on the development of end-to-end efficient Deep Learning and Tiny Machine Learning pipelines for drone applications.

With extensive experience as a Research Scientist in Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning, my expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of ML/DL domains. I specialize in Graph Neural Networks, Tiny ML, and Computer Vision, consistently pushing the boundaries of these innovative technologies.

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Optimization. My current research focus is on **Efficient Deep Learning**, **On-device/Tiny ML**, and **Generative AI**. Here are the research themes that I am currently working on: 

- Tiny Graph Neural Networks
- Efficient Training and Fine-tuning of Large Models
- Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks
- Tiny Computer Vision Models

I previously received a Ph.D. in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in August 2023, and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shiraz University.
