## Digital Signal Processing

In the Fall of 2024, I'm instructing a graduate-level course, **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst). This course, designed for 48 registered students, focuses on the theory, algorithms, and practical applications of signal processing, with a strong emphasis on engineering challenges and solutions. The curriculum has been tailored to provide students with both foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in processing digital signals across various domains.

### Course Highlights

This course offers a comprehensive exploration of key DSP concepts and methodologies, including:

- **Fundamentals of Discrete-Time Signals and Systems**: Students are introduced to the basic principles of discrete-time signals and systems, laying the groundwork for understanding the core operations of DSP, including convolution, difference equations, and Z-transforms.

- **Digital Filter Design**: This section covers the design of both Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, providing students with the tools to shape signals for desired applications in areas such as communication, audio, and control systems.

- **Sampling and Reconstruction**: Students learn the theory and techniques of converting analog signals into digital form and reconstructing them, emphasizing the importance of Nyquist theory and practical considerations for avoiding aliasing.

- **Linear Algebra for Digital Signal Processing**: Describe a range of signal processing problems using the language of bases and vector spaces, and using the singular value decomposition to solve and analyze a range of least-squares problems.
